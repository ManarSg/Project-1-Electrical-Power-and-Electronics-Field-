 Designing a Circuit to control 5 Servo Motors Using POT.
 
 As shown in the schematic diagram the circuit components are:
 -Power Source 5 V
 -Arduino Uno
 -5 Servo Motors
 -BreadBoard 
 -POT "Potentiometer 20K ohms"
 
Notes to be taken into consideration:
-This circuit is designed to make 1 potentiometer controlling the whole 5 servo motors. 
-Depending on the resistance values of potentiometer, the servo motos brushes move. 
-Adjusted angles are 0,90,180 degree; So, the difference between all moves is 90 degree.
