# Project-1-Electrical-Power-and-Electronics-Field-
 Designing a Circuit to control 5 Servo Motors Using POT.
 
 This project contains 3 files as follows:
 - C++ code file, for programming the Arduino.
 - PNG file for the circuit schematic diagram.
 - BRD file to simulate the circuit in Tinkercad. 
 
 As shown in the schematic diagram the circuit components are:
 - Power Source 5 V
 - Arduino Uno
 - 5 Servo Motors
 - BreadBoard 
 - POT "Potentiometer 20K ohms"
 
Notes to be taken into consideration:
- This circuit is designed to make 1 potentiometer controlling the whole 5 servo motors. 
- Depending on the resistance values of potentiometer, the servo motos brushes move. 
- Adjusted angles are 0,90,180 degree; So, the difference between all moves is 90 degree.
